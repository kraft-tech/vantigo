# 🏛️ Governance Model
Vantigo is owned and maintained by Kraft-Tech AS. Our governance model emphasizes transparency, community involvement, 
and a commitment to maintaining high standards in software development.  

## Key Principles 
- Transparency: We strive to maintain an open line of communication with users and contributors regarding our decisions, processes, and future directions. 
- Prioritization: While we welcome feedback and feature requests, our core team at Kraft-Tech AS will determine the priority of new features and fixes to ensure the stability and progress of the project.
- Community Engagement: We highly value input from our users and community members. Open discussions around proposed features and changes are encouraged.
     

## 📋 Decision-Making Process 
### Feature Requests   
Users can submit feature requests via GitHub Issues. Each request will be reviewed by the core team, and feedback will 
be provided regarding its status and potential implementation timeline.
         
### Prioritization Criteria   
Requests will be prioritized based on:
1. Impact on user experience.
2. Alignment with our product roadmap.
3. Technical feasibility.
4. User demand and community support.
             
### Implementation   
The core team will manage all implementation tasks. While community contributions are welcome and encouraged, final 
coding and integration will be conducted by Kraft-Tech AS developers to maintain code quality and consistency.
