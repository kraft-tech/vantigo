## 📖 Introduction 
> **NOTE**: Vantigo is in an early stage of the development phase, please expect lots of changes here in the near future!

Vantigo is an open-source all-round multipurpose solution for business that want to level up their operations and utilize
IT to get shit done. The Vantigo solution consists of several components that can be used depending on the need of the
business. These components are built to integrate with one another, ensuring that you don't need to maintain several
integrations between different systems.

## 🚀 Components
- **Customers**: A powerful and simple CRM solution that allows you to have a strong relationship with your customers
- **Invoices**: A simple and elegant invoicing solution that generates and tracks payments from your customers
- **Messages**: A solution for receiving and sending messages over various channels, including Email, RCS/SMS and other social media channels
- **Time**: An intuitive time tracker for employees where they can manage time spent on one or several projects in one place
- **Workflows**: A no-code/low code solution for creating workflows when certain things happen in one of the components
> More will be added later, if you have any suggestions, please create a feature request explaining your needs

## 🛠️ Getting Started 
Vantigo can either be purchased as a SaaS offering by the company that builds and knows the systems in and out. If this
is not something for you, then you can also self-host Vantigo on your own infrastructure. 

### SaaS offering
> We are currently very early in the development phase of Vantigo and as of now, we don't have a SaaS solution ready
> for prime time. Please come back later, follow and/or star our repository for more updates.

### Self-Hosted
> We are currently very early in the development phase of Vantigo and as of now, we don't have a self-hosted solution
> ready for prime time. Please come back later, follow and/or star our repository for more updates.
